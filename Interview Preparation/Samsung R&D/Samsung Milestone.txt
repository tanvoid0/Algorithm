a. Recursion (Brute Force):
	i. Permutation: O(n!) solution to propblems.
	ii. Combination: O(nCr) solution to problems.
	iii. Subset O(2^n) solution to problems
	iv. Simulation: Variable time complexity
		1. Board Game Simulation
		2. Job Scheduling simulation
		3. Rotating/Reflecting/Copying 2D array simulation

b. Graphs:
	i. Graphs represented with 2D array
	ii. DFS
	iii. BFS: Queue implementation might be required

c. Basic algorithms:
	i. O(n^2) array sorting (quick sort)
	ii. Queue/Stack Data Structures
	iii. Successive Sums
	iv. Any Algorithms you can find whic are not hard to implement or do not require any concept
